# Web Dev. Portfolio

- This is a portfolio projec tthat will display all of my work throughout my web developing career. The page will be clear and modern looking and also be fully functional to display my talent.

- My motivation for this project is to showcase my work throughout my programming career and also to display growth from when I started coding.

- I built this project in order to test myself as to how much I will grow from the beginnings of when I first began coding all the way to when I get my certificate in full stack web development.

- It solves the problem of employers having to go through a hassle and open a bunch of links to view a possible future employee's work. This project makes it easy and simple to do this.

- I learned how to use css in order to manipulate colors, positioning, behavior, and also sizing in the dom.

- A finished photo of my webpage will is here.
