# HTML CSS GIT CHALLENGE

- This is a project that I will be refactoring code in order to meet the user story's criteria

- My motivation to do this was to get an understanding and fele of what employers might ask of me to do in the future.

- I built ths project to test myself and see how well I could implement the knowledge that I had learned from class. This exercise solidified a lot of knowledge for me.

- It solves the problem of the webpage being disorganized and not user accessible. Also the user story is not fulfilled.

- I learned that addind alt tags to an img add to user accessibility.
